# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Status Bar are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.0.2] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Desktop app watcher: the menu bar icon now appears the moment the Claude desktop app opens, before you start a conversation, and disappears shortly after you quit it. Previously the icon only showed once a session began. Implemented as a lightweight `launchd` LaunchAgent that tracks the Claude desktop process (installed via `install.js`, removed via `uninstall.js`).

### Changed
- Ending a Claude Code session no longer hides the icon while the Claude desktop app is still open.

### Fixed
- Uninstall now removes all of the app's own hooks, including the `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` lifecycle hooks that a previous version left behind. It only ever touches this app's hooks, never any others.

### Notes
- The desktop watcher is part of the DMG / standalone install path. The Claude Code plugin install path keeps the session-only behavior.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Initial release: macOS menu bar status indicator for Claude Code, driven entirely by Claude Code hooks.
- Animated Claude spark, elapsed turn timer, and an "awaiting permission" dot.
- Two animation styles (Claude, Claude Code) and two color modes (Orange, System), persisted in preferences.
- Refcounted session lifecycle: launches when Claude Code opens, quits when the last session ends.
- Signed and notarized DMG so it opens without a Gatekeeper warning.
- Claude Code plugin marketplace manifest for the plugin install path.
